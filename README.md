# Accounting GUI app

## Unfinished
An app is currently unfinished

## Why?
I started to learn Rust in summer 2024, as I progressed I decided to build something highlevel and useful for me. 
A process I wanted to upgrade is expenses tracking. I started tracking my expenses at the beginning of 2024. I used notes app and excel. Each month I had to manually calculate sums and insert them to the spreadsheet. My first attempt to save me some time was a simple python script which would calculate everything for me, although
I still had to manually put summaries into excel. So I came up with a wonderful idea to create a GUI app that would save me 2-5 minutes every month.TimeIsMoney (app name) should provide me simple way to receive, process data and insert it into spreadsheet. I thought that it wasn't enough so I decided that this app should also provide me some statistics on my data stored in excel. 

### Learning outcomes 
After finishing an app I'd:
- finally try to use Rust for something (not low level yet)
- know more about GUI libraries for Rust
- read a lot of documentation 
- become a better designer
- save my own time 
- know that stats modules at Uni are not useless 
- know more about data visualization
